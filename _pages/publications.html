<p style="margin-top: 30px;"> * The authors' list is always in alphabetical order in our group. The lead author(s) is usually indicated as the "corresponding author" in the papers. In [1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9], I was a lead author and I played a primary role (coming up with the idea, algorithms, proofs, etc.). The main idea of [5] was initiated in one of our discussions with YA inspired by [4]. Youssef then did all the heavy lifting for this work.
  Initially, [7] was NG and RPâ€™s project, studying the impact of momentum in Byzantine ML. In a group meeting, I noticed that their
  approach can be generalized by changing the definition of robustness to the one used in [9]. I then joined the project and proved that this
  definition is satisfied by almost all existing works, which led to a unifying framework for Byzantine machine learning.</p>
