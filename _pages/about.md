I am a third-year PhD student in the computer and communication science department at EPFL. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Rachid Guerraoui](http://lpdwww.epfl.ch/rachid/), a world leader in distributed computing. Before coming to EPFL, I earned a B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology. 

My main line of research is in distributed optimization and machine learning, with a focus on robustness, fault-tolerance and privacy.
