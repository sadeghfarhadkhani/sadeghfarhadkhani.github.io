<p>
  I am a third-year PhD student in the computer and communication science department at EPFL. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof.
  <a href="http://lpdwww.epfl.ch/rachid/">Rachid Guerraoui</a>, a world leader in distributed computing. Before coming to EPFL, I earned a B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.
</p>
<p>
  My main line of research is in distributed optimization and machine learning, with a focus on robustness, fault-tolerance, and privacy.
