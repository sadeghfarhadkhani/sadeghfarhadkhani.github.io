<p>
  I am currently working on applied machine learning and AI with real-world impact, and I am not on the job market. I received my Ph.D. from the Computer and Communication Sciences Department at <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/sadegh.farhadkhani?lang=en">EPFL</a>  in July 2025, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="http://lpdwww.epfl.ch/rachid/">Rachid Guerraoui</a>, a world leader in distributed computing. Prior to joining EPFL, I earned a B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.
</p>
<p>
  My main line of research is in distributed optimization and machine learning, with a focus on robustness, fault-tolerance, and privacy.

<p style="margin-top: 30px;"> * The authors' list is always in alphabetical order in our group. The lead author(s) is usually indicated as the "corresponding author" in the papers. In [1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9], I was a lead author and I played a primary role (coming up with the idea, algorithms, proofs, etc.). The main idea of [5] was initiated in one of our discussions with YA inspired by [4]. Youssef then did all the heavy lifting for this work.
  Initially, [7] was NG and RP’s project, studying the impact of momentum in Byzantine ML. In a group meeting, I noticed that their
  approach can be generalized by changing the definition of robustness to the one used in [9]. I then joined the project and proved that this
  definition is satisfied by almost all existing works, which led to a unifying framework for Byzantine machine learning.</p>
